  abstract  = {This article proposes a technique for boundary detection in speckled imagery based on active contours and on the statistical properties of speckled data. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), sonar, B-ultrasound and laser imagery is corrupted by a signal-dependent non-additive noise called speckle. Many statistical models have been proposed to describe this noise, aiming at the development of specialized techniques for image improvement and analysis. The G0 distribution is a statistical model that succeeds in describing a wide range of areas as, for instance in {SAR} data, pastures (smooth), forests (rough) and urban (extremely rough) areas. In order to determine boundaries between different areas, dynamic B-splines are proposed in this paper. The algorithm automatically finds seeds and regions boundaries by a decision rule based on the estimation of the parameters of the G0 law. The proposed algorithm is tested on synthetic and real {SAR} images, and both the accuracy and the performance of the proposal are assessed.},

abstract="One of the main problems of {SAR} imagery is the presence of speckle noise, originated by the inherent coherent nature of this type of systems. For one-dimensional {SAR} systems it has been demonstrated that speckle can be considered as a multiplicative noise term. Nevertheless, this simple model cannot be exported when multidimensional {SAR} imagery is addressed. This paper is devoted to present the latest advances into the definition of a multidimensional speckle noise model which does not depend on the data dimensionality. Speckle noise may be modeled by multiplicative and additive noise sources, whose combination is determined by the data's correlation structure. The validity of the proposed model is demonstrated by its application to a real L-band multidimensional {SAR} dataset acquired by the German ESAR sensor.",

Abstract = {We present an approach for polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image region boundary detection based on the use of B-Spline active contours and a new model for polarimetric {SAR} data: the GHP distribution. In order to detect the boundary of a region, initial B-Spline curves are specified, either automatically or manually, and the proposed algorithm uses a deformable contours technique to find the boundary. In doing this, the parameters of the polarimetric GHP model for the data are estimated, in order to find the transition points between the region being segmented and the surrounding area. This is a local algorithm since it works only on the region to be segmented. Results of its performance are presented.},

ABSTRACT = {A new electromagnetic approach for the simulation of polarimetric {SAR} images is proposed. It starts from Maxwell?s equations, employs the spectral domain full-wave technique, the moment method, and the stationary phase method to compute the far electromagnetic fields scattered by multilayer structures. A multilayer structure is located at each selected position of a regular rectangular grid of coordinates, which defines the scene area under imaging. The grid is determined taking into account the elementary scatter size and {SAR} operational parameters, such as spatial resolution, pixel spacing, look angle and platform altitude. A two-dimensional separable ?sinc? function to represent the {SAR} spread point function is also considered. Multifrequency sets of single-look polarimetric {SAR} images are generated, in L-, C- and X-bands and the images are evaluated using several measurements commonly employed in {SAR} data analysis. The evaluation shows that the proposed simulation process is working properly, since the obtained results are in accordance with those presented in the literature. Therefore, this new approach becomes suitable for carrying out theoretical and practical studies using polarimetric {SAR} images.},

abstract="Extraction of features, such as edges for the understanding of aerial images, has been an important objective since the early days of remote sensing. This work aims at describing a new framework which allows for the quantitative combination of a preselected set of edge detectors based on the correspondence between their outcomes. This is inspired from the problem that despite the enormous amount of literature on edge detection techniques, there is no single technique that performs well in every possible image context. Two approaches are proposed for this purpose. The first approach is the well-known receiver operating characteristics analysis which is introduced for a sound quality evaluation of the edge maps estimated by combining different edge detectors. In the second approach, the so-called kappa statistics are employed in a novel fashion to amalgamate the above-mentioned selected edge maps to form an improved final edge image. This method is unique in the sense that the balance between the false detections (false positives and false negatives) is explicitly determined in advance and incorporated in the proposed method in a mathematical fashion. For the performance evaluation of the proposed techniques, a sample set of the RADIUS/DARPA-IU Fort Hood aerial image database with known ground truth has been used.",

ABSTRACT = {Knowledge of the exact statistical properties of the signal plays an important role in the applications of Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) data. In the last three decades, a considerable research effort has been devoted to finding accurate statistical models for PolSAR data, and a number of distributions have been proposed. In order to see the differences of various models and to make a comparison among them, a survey is provided in this paper. Texture models, which could capture the non-Gaussian behavior observed in high resolution data, and yet keep a compact mathematical form, are mainly explained. Probability density functions for the single look data and the multilook data are reviewed, as well as the advantages and applicable context of those models. As a summary, challenges in the area of statistical analysis of PolSAR data are also discussed.},

	abstract = {Remote Sensing is both an active research area and the source of valuable information for decision-making. Many actors play a fundamental role in Remote Sensing, from industry (public or private) to large or small research groups. From that intensive activity, methods, algorithms, and techniques are continuously published or broadcasted through papers, conference presentations, repositories, patents, standards, and other means. The consumers of that information need it to be readily available and dependable. Reproducible research can handle those needs. In this article, we discuss two concepts: reproducibility and replicability in the context of Remote Sensing research. We propose a badging system suited to the specifics of the Remote Sensing community. Such a system aims at both recognizing the level of the reproducibility of the research, and to help increase its visibility. We show examples of reproducible research and provide clues to make easier the transition to the inevitable new times that embrace contemporary science and technology.},

abstract = {Many real-world data-mining applications involve obtaining predictive models using datasets with strongly imbalanced distributions of the target variable. Frequently, the least-common values of this target variable are associated with events that are highly relevant for end users (e.g., fraud detection, unusual returns on stock markets, anticipation of catastrophes, etc.). Moreover, the events may have different costs and benefits, which, when associated with the rarity of some of them on the available training data, creates serious problems to predictive modeling techniques. This article presents a survey of existing techniques for handling these important applications of predictive analytics. Although most of the existing work addresses classification tasks (nominal target variables), we also describe methods designed to handle similar problems within regression tasks (numeric target variables). In this survey, we discuss the main challenges raised by imbalanced domains, propose a definition of the problem, describe the main approaches to these tasks, propose a taxonomy of the methods, summarize the conclusions of existing comparative studies as well as some theoretical analyses of some methods, and refer to some related problems within predictive modeling.},

abstract="There is large consent that successful training of deep networks requires many thousand annotated training samples. In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU. The full implementation (based on Caffe) and the trained networks are available at http://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net.",

      abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) have transformed computer vision, establishing themselves as the current state-of-the-art for image processing. Nevertheless, the training of current large DNN models is one of the main challenges to be solved. In this sense, data-parallelism has been the most widespread distributed training strategy since it is easy to program and can be applied to almost all cases. However, this solution suffers from several limitations, such as its high communication requirements and the memory constraints when training very large models. To overcome these limitations model-parallelism has been proposed, solving the most substantial problems of the former strategy. However, describing and implementing the parallelization of the training of a DNN model across a set of processes deployed on several devices is a challenging task. Current proposed solutions assume a homogeneous distribution, being impractical when working with devices of different computational capabilities, which is quite common on high performance computing platforms. To address previous shortcomings, this work proposes a novel model-parallelism technique considering heterogeneous platforms, where a load balancing mechanism between uneven devices of an HPC platform has been implemented. Our proposal takes advantage of the Google Brain’s Mesh-TensorFlow for convolutional networks, splitting computing tensors across filter dimension in order to balance the computational load of the available devices. Conducted experiments show an improvement in the exploitation of heterogeneous computational resources, enhancing the training performance.

This distribution has applications in the processing of multilook synthetic aperture radar data. The expression for the density is in the form of an infinite series that converges rapidly and is simple and fast to compute. The expression is shown to reduce to known forms for a number of special cases and is validated by simulation. The characteristic function is also derived and used to relate joint moments of the trivariate distribution to the parameters of the density function.},

  abstract = {Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) systems are an important remote sensing tool. Such systems can provide high spacial resolution images, but they are contaminated by an interference pattern called multidimensional speckle. This fact requires that PolSAR images receive specialised treatment; particularly, tailored models which are close to PolSAR physical formation are sought. In this paper, we propose two new matrix models which arise from applying the stochastic summation approach to PolSAR, called compound truncated Poisson complex Wishart (CTPCW) and compound geometric complex Wishart (CGCW) distributions. These models offer the unique ability to express multimodal data. Some of their mathematical properties are derived and discussed— characteristic function and Mellin-kind log-cumulants (MLCs). Moreover, maximum likelihood (ML) estimation procedures via expectation maximisation algorithm for CTPCW and CGCW parameters are furnished as well as MLC-based goodness-of-fit graphical tools. Monte Carlo experiment results indicate ML estimates perform at what is asymptotically expected (small bias and mean square error) even for small sample sizes. Finally, our proposals are employed to describe actual PolSAR images, presenting evidence that they can outperform other well-known distributions, such as WmC, Gm0 , and Km.},
